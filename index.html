        <h1>11 REASONS WHY YOU NEED TO VISIT CROATIA</h1>

        <p>Sprawling beaches, picturesque towns and stunning scenery – Croatia has all the ingredients you need for the
            ultimate summer holiday, proving popular among honeymooners, families and large groups alike. Have you ever
            found yourself wondering what all the fuss is about? To help you understand this sun-drenched country’s
            enduring appeal, we’ve put together a list of the top reasons why you need to visit Croatia – and some of
            them may surprise you!</p>


        <h2>1. It’s easy to reach</h2>
        <p>Hvar, Split, Dubrovnik and Pula are all just two and a half hours away (or less!), which makes getting there
            with young ones as fuss-free as possible. But even if you’re jetting off with a group of friends, Croatia
            still trumps trips to the Canaries or Greek Islands when it comes to travel time, meaning you can all hit
            the beach that much faster.</p>
        </h2>
        <h2>2. Knock-out beaches</h2>
        <p>Croatia is famed for its scenic pebbled beaches, which are beautifully lapped by crystal-clear waters. One of
            the
            most well known is Brac‘s Zlatni Rat, also referred to as the Golden Cape. The tip of the beach is
            everchanging
            with the wind, meaning you never know quite what shape it’ll take when you visit. This location is a
            protected
            area as well as a tourist magnet, attracting visitors from all around the world.</p>

        <h4><em>Zlatni Rat Beach, Bol, Croatia</em></h4>
        <p>If you’d prefer to escape the crowds, you can easily rent a boat from Hvar to enjoy Stiniva Beach. This
            hidden
            gem is literally concealed by two towering cliffs. Once you’ve sailed inside, you’ll feel like you’ve truly
            entered an earthly paradise, with crowd levels being minimal due to its location on the farthest inhabited
            island in Dalmatia.

        <h2>3. The Game of Thrones appeal</h2>
        <p>Fans of the show will need no convincing! You can visit some of the series’ top locations with the Game of
            Thrones tour, recreating pictures of your favourite scenes. Among the attractions to have been featured are
            Dubrovnik’s city walls, which became King’s Landing; The Fortress of Kliss, which is the City of Meereen;
            and
            Trsteno Arboretum, which became the Garden of Red Keep. All that’s left to do is find a dragon…</p>
        <h2>4. Festivals galore!</h2>
        <p>Croatia has quickly become a firm favourite with festival goers, hosting an array of world-class musicians.
            Ultra
            Europe, Sonus and Fresh Island Festival are just a mere taste of the summer’s biggest draws. Most take place
            on
            the beach or somewhere secluded, so get ready to dance until you drop.</p>

        <h2>5. Destination Dubrovnik</h2>
        <p>Utterly enchanting, this ‘Pearl of the Adriatic’ has to be experienced at least once in your life. The best
            way
            to see Dubrovnik is to get on top of the city’s walls, stretching around the Old Town at a distance
            totalling
            1.2 miles. That vantage point allows you to see the damage of the war up close, all the while admiring the
            city’s ethereal beauty. So, even with the crowds, this is simply a must-visit.</p>

        <h2>6. The seafood</h2>
        <p>Plucked straight out of the Adriatic Sea, the seafood served across Croatia will be some of the freshest
            you’ve ever tasted. Whetheryou prefer your oysters and octopus to be served as part of a stew or risotto,
            the flavours will be simply unmatched.</a></p>
