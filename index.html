            <h1>11 reasons wy you need to visit to croatia</h1>

            <p>Sprawling beaches, picturesque towns and stunning scenery – Croatia has all the ingredients you need
                for
                the
                ultimate summer holiday, proving popular among honeymooners, families and large groups alike. Have
                you
                ever
                found yourself wondering what all the fuss is about? To help you understand this sun-drenched
                country’s
                enduring appeal, we’ve put together a list of the top reasons why you need to visit Croatia – and
                some
                of
                them may surprise you!</p>
            <h2>1. It’s easy to reach</h2>
            <p>Hvar, Split, Dubrovnik and Pula are all just two and a half hours away (or less!), which makes
                getting
                there
                with young ones as fuss-free as possible. But even if you’re jetting off with a group of friends,
                Croatia
                still trumps trips to the Canaries or Greek Islands when it comes to travel time, meaning you can
                all
                hit
                the beach that much faster.</p>
            <h2>2. Knock-out beaches</h2>
            <p>Croatia is famed for its scenic pebbled beaches, which are beautifully lapped by crystal-clear
                waters.
                One of
                the
                most well known is Brac‘s Zlatni Rat, also referred to as the Golden Cape. The tip of the beach is
                everchanging
                with the wind, meaning you never know quite what shape it’ll take when you visit. This location is a
                protected
                area as well as a tourist magnet, attracting visitors from all around the world.</p>
            <img src="img/zlatni_rat_beach.jpg" alt="Zlatni Rat Beach, Bol, Croatia">
            <h4><em>Zlatni Rat Beach, Bol, Croatia</em></h4>
            <p>If you’d prefer to escape the crowds, you can easily rent a boat from Hvar to enjoy Stiniva Beach.
                This
                hidden
                gem is literally concealed by two towering cliffs. Once you’ve sailed inside, you’ll feel like
                you’ve
                truly
                entered an earthly paradise, with crowd levels being minimal due to its location on the farthest
                inhabited
                island in Dalmatia.
            </p>

            <h4><em>Stiniva Bay, Vis Island, Croatia</em></h4>
            <h2>3. The Game of Thrones appeal</h2>
            <p>Fans of the show will need no convincing! You can visit some of the series’ top locations with the
                Game
                of
                Thrones tour, recreating pictures of your favourite scenes. Among the attractions to have been
                featured
                are
                Dubrovnik’s city walls, which became King’s Landing; The Fortress of Kliss, which is the City of
                Meereen;
                and
                Trsteno Arboretum, which became the Garden of Red Keep. All that’s left to do is find a dragon…</p>
            <h2>4. Festivals galore!</h2>
            <p>Croatia has quickly become a firm favourite with festival goers, hosting an array of world-class
                musicians.
                Ultra
                Europe, Sonus and Fresh Island Festival are just a mere taste of the summer’s biggest draws. Most
                take
                place
                on
                the beach or somewhere secluded, so get ready to dance until you drop.</p>

            <h2>5. Destination Dubrovnik</h2>
            <p>Utterly enchanting, this ‘Pearl of the Adriatic’ has to be experienced at least once in your life.
                The
                best
                way
                to see Dubrovnik is to get on top of the city’s walls, stretching around the Old Town at a distance
                totalling
                1.2 miles. That vantage point allows you to see the damage of the war up close, all the while
                admiring
                the
                city’s ethereal beauty. So, even with the crowds, this is simply a must-visit.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>6. The seafood</h2>
            <p>Plucked straight out of the Adriatic Sea, the seafood served across Croatia will be some of the
                freshest
                you’ve ever tasted. Whetheryou prefer your oysters and octopus to be served as part of a stew or
                risotto,
                the flavours will be simply unmatched.</p>
